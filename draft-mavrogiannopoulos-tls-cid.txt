1.  Introduction

   In DTLS, the security context demultiplexing is done via the 5-tuple.
   This implies that the associated DTLS context needs to be re-
   negotiated from scratch whenever the transport identifiers change.
   For example, when moving the network attachment from WLAN to a
   cellular connection, or when the IP address of the IoT devices
   changes during a sleep cycle.  A NAT device may also modify the
   source UDP port after an idle period.  In such situations, there is
   not enough information in the DTLS record header for a DTLS server,
   which handles multiple clients, to associate the new address to an
   existing client.

   This memo proposes a new TLS extension [RFC6066] that allows a
   transport independent identifier to be associated to a given DTLS
   session.

2.  Conventions used in this document
